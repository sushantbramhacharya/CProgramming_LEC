# Generation of the computer
- ## First Generation Computer
    - Computers like UNIVAC
    - Uses Vaccumn tubes as main technonlogy
    - Covers large Area
    - Slow processing Power than other Generations
- ## Second Generation Computer
    - Uses Transistors as main technonlogy
    - Compact than First Gens
    - Faster than First Gen Computer
- ## Third Gen Computer
    - Intergreted Circuit were used.
    - Modern Language started getting used like C Pascal FORTRAN.
    - Faster.
    - Small Size.
    - Multiple Transistors and electronic Component were Intergreted in Single Chip
    - IBM 370


# Difference between compiler and interpreter
## Compiler
- It scans whole source code and compile it into object code
- Takes more time to compile the code.
- Requires more memory.
- Generates object code and requires further linking in code.
- Languages like C,C++ and Java uses compiler.
## Interpreter
- It scans program line by Line.
- It requires less time to analyze and interpret the code.
- Doesnot generate Object code.
- Requires less memory code
- Languages like Python and Javascript uses Interpreter.
