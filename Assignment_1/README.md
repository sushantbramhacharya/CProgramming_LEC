# Generation of the computer
- ## First Generation Computer
- Computers like UNIVAC
- Uses Vaccumn tubes as main technonlogy
- Covers large Area
- Slow processing Power than other Generations
# Difference between compiler and interpreter
## Compiler
- It scans whole source code and compile it into object code
- Takes more time to compile the code.
- Requires more memory.
- Generates object code and requires further linking in code.
- Languages like C,C++ and Java uses compiler.
## Interpreter
- It scans program line by Line.
- It requires less time to analyze and interpret the code.
- Doesnot generate Object code.
- Requires less memory code
- Languages like Python and Javascript uses Interpreter.
