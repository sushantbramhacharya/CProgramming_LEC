# Selection sort
In this type of sorting we sort by checking 
- In first Iteration of(i)l
    - Is 1st element greater than elements behind it and swap if its greates
- Like wise the other iterations does the same until array is sorted
# Bubble sort
In this type of sorting we sort by checking 
- Greatest number is bubbled out first
- In first Iteration of(i)
    - Is 1st element greater than elements behind it.
- Like wise the other iterations does the same until array is sorted
# Insertion sort
- Divided into two sub array
    - Sorted array only index 0(at 1st iteration)
    - Unsorted array rest of all
- Continously checked and shifted right to get forted array
# Linear Search
- This is simplest searching algorithms.
- It searches array Linearly.
